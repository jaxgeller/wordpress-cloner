#wordpress-cloner

This goes into an existing wordpress instance, logs in, downloads a backup, spins up docker, loads the backup in, and you have a 'cloned' wordpress instance running.  This is great if you push something live, and you dont want to ftp changes.

### Dependencies

+ docker

git clone this repo
